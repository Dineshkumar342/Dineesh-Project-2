Project Title : Double Machine Learning for Heterogeneous Treatment Effects

Project Overview

This project implements Double Machine Learning (DML) to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects in a synthetic high-dimensional dataset. It includes data generation, cross-fitted machine learning, CATE estimation, sensitivity analysis, and structured documentation for reproducibility and transparency.



Files and Structure

1) data_generation.py : Script to generate synthetic data (`synthetic_data.csv`) with 2000 samples, 50+ confounders, treatment assignment, and continuous outcome.
2) dml_implementation.py : Implements cross-fitting DML using Random Forests for nuisance parameter estimation; saves out-of-fold predictions (`dml_crossfit_residuals.npz`).
3) cate_estimation.py : Calculates residuals and estimates Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE); outputs to `cate_estimates.csv`.
4) sensitivity_analysis.py : Analyzes CATE variation across subgroups (X1, X2, X3); results saved to `sensitivity_analysis_stdout.txt`.
5) requirements.txt : Lists dependencies (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, tested on Python 3.7.8).


How to Run

1. **Install dependencies:**
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
2. **Generate synthetic data:**
   
   python data_generation.py
   
3. **Compute nuisance estimates with DML:**
   
   python dml_implementation.py
   
4. **Estimate CATE:**
   
   python cate_estimation.py
   
5. **Sensitivity analysis:**
   
   python sensitivity_analysis.py
   



Outputs

1) synthetic_data.csv : Main dataset with covariates, treatment, and outcomes.
2) dml_crossfit_residuals.npz : Out-of-fold model predictions.
3) cate_estimates.csv : Dataset including estimated treatment effects.
4) sensitivity_analysis_stdout.txt : Mean CATE for subgroups of X1, X2, and X3.



Documentation

    Data generation, modeling choices, cross-fitting strategy, and interpretations are documented within each script and summarized in this submission file.



Report Summary

1) Synthetic dataset contains nonlinear, heterogeneous treatment effects.
2) DML with cross-fitting corrects for bias in high-dimensional settings.
3) Linear regression of residualized outcome on residualized treatment delivers the CATE.
4) Sensitivity analysis confirms heterogeneity of the treatment effect with respect to covariates X1, X2, and X3.
5) All steps are reproducible with provided scripts.
